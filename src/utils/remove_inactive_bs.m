function [data1, data2, inactive] = remove_inactive_bs(data1, data2, window_of_inactivity)
%% Removes segments where BS data may have been absent.
% Inactive  BS data is defined as any sequence of x milliseconds or higher where the sum of the difference between the signals is 0.
%
% **Usage:** [data1, data2, inactive] = remove_inactive_bs(data1, data2, window_of_inactivity)
%
% Input(s):
%   - data1 = Data set that contains inactive sequences.
%   - data2 = Data set of equal length to data1, whose inactive sequences are also to be removed
%   - window_of_inactivity = integer of size x representing the size of inactive sequences
%
% Output(s):
%   - data1 = dataset 1 without inactive sections
%   - data2 = dataset 2 without inactive sections
%   - inactive = boolean array with the points that are inactive as 0 and active as 1 or indices of inactive points
