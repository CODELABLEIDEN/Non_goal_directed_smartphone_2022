# Data alignment: Bendsensor to Forcesensor
To achieve alignment of Bendsensor(BS) and Forcesensor(FS) data, a Bidirectional Long short-term memory (BiLSTM) is trained. This documentation explains the alignment process using moving averages of the BS data as the features.

During the measurements of the data, the participants alternated between using their smartphone to collect taps, and using a 'box' which measured FS data. The BS measurements were collected throughout the whole measurement process. Thus, for each participant, the data had to be separated, because only the sections which contained BS and FS data were used during training.

# Data preparation
The data preparation is performed in Matlab R2019b.
## Bendsensor
The model input is BS data. Moving averages are used as features to the model.

The data preparation consisted of the following steps:

**Pre-processing**
1. Raw BS data: EEG.Aligned.BS.Data(:,1).
2. To remove movement irrelevant information from the BS data a bandpass filter is used with a range of 1 to 10 Hz.
3. Outlier detection and removal
4. Segments where BS data may have been absent are removed. Missing BS data is defined as any sequence of 1000 milliseconds or higher where the sum of the difference between the signals is 0.
5. Three participants were visually identified to have flipped BS data. This occurs when the BS was attached the wrong way during data collection. These are participant DS02, DS07 and DS22. The BS is flipped before training for these participants


**Moving averages**
1. Calculate the moving average over each time window, where each mean is calculated over a sliding window of length k. For the first calculation k is 10. Shrink endpoints of moving averages
3. Repeat step 2 and 3, i times. k grows in steps of 10.

# Forcesensor
The model output is FS data.

**Pre-processing**
1. Raw FS data: EEG.Aligned.BS.Data(:,2)  
1. No movement pressure in the FS data is shown as values ranging from -0.8 to -1. As no pressure is always the same, all these values were transformed to one common value which is -1.
2. The FS contained noise. These are seen as fast spikes smaller than 5 ms. These spikes are too fast to be real movements and were thus set as no movement (-1).
3. Sampling rate of the FS is 1000 Hz.

The data is exported as a h5 file. The structure is :
/participant_fileNumber/participant_windowNumber/filename_filetype_windowNumber
As an example for participant DS01 file 1 window 2 the file looks like:
/DS01_1/DS01_1_win_2/DS01_BS_2

# Model
The model is a simple bidirectional lstm. It was trained in Keras version 2.2.4. This is necessary to be able to import the Keras model into matlab.
### MA model
```
model = keras.Sequential()

model.add(keras.layers.Bidirectional(keras.layers.LSTM(100, return_sequences=True), input_shape=(timesteps,num_features)))
model.add(keras.layers.Bidirectional(keras.layers.LSTM(64)))
model.add(keras.layers.Dense(1000))

model.summary()
model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer='adam')
```
The model was trained in batches of shape (B,T,F), where B is 10, T is 1000 and F is 100.
The loss function was mean squared error and the optimizer Adam. Models are trained for 5 epochs.


# Prediction
The model was imported into matlab for prediction, using the Deep Learning Toolbox.

The data is prepared for prediction in the same way as it was prepared for training. The prediction is performed in batches.

# Model results

- MA_inverted_full.json
